# Adaptive Multi-Factor Models (ACM)

This repository contains the implementation of Adaptive Multi-Factor Models (ACM) for financial analysis. ACM dynamically adjusts factor weights to capture changing market conditions.

## Features
- Calculation of dynamic factor weights
- Integration of macroeconomic factors
- Visualization of factor dependencies
- Analysis of expected returns based on adaptive weights

## Directory Structure
- `src/`: Source code for ACM calculations and visualizations
- `tests/`: Unit tests for each module
- `data/`: Input and output data, including charts and reports
- `notebooks/`: Demonstrative Jupyter notebooks
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
- `README.md`: Project documentation

## Usage
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
